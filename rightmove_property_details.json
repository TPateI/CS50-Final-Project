The other apartments will have a separate entrance on the other side of the building and can be let as individual units or, due to the clever flow of the design, can act as wings in very large family home.

Unfolding laterally across the first floor of an imposing Grade II-listed building, the interior spaces have recently undergone a sympathetic restoration that celebrates the building's period features, including voluminous ceiling heights and parquet flooring, while introducing an earthy material and colour palette. The apartment has private allotted parking and a landscaped communal resident's garden to the rear.\r<br />\r<br />Setting the Scene\u00a0\r<br />\r<br />Birch Lodge was constructed in the mid-19th-century in the Italianate style and is one of the few remaining buildings of the period on Copse Hill. Faced in yellow brick, it has been finished with intricate stone architraves, banding and corbelled eaves. Widely developed in the 1850s, it is one of a handful of villas erected on what was named the Cottenham Park estate. Copse Hill was widened in 1925, and much of the area's present housing dates from this time. The few grand villas remaining are listed for their architectural significance, saving them for future generations. For more information, please see the History section below.\u00a0\r<br />\r<br />The Grand Tour\u00a0\r<br />\r<br />Stairs ascend from the grand communal entrance stairwell to the first floor, where the apartment is accessed via a bright, airy reception hall.

Finished in Farrow & Ball paint and with hardwood parquet flooring, the room is complemented by antique French folding doors from c.1800. Two large sash windows are flanked by bespoke shutters and cast light across the immaculately executed interiors.\r<br />\r<br />A bespoke Beeck kitchen by Arlington Design has integrated Siemens appliances and a copper sink. The kitchen walls have been treated in a plaster finish by Craig & Rose, blending with the bespoke cabinetry. A floating island divides the cooking space from the living and dining areas, which both have more than enough space for entertaining on a large scale.\r<br />\r<br />A set of double doors leads from the reception room to the primary bedroom suite, which is bathed in natural light welcomed in by a triple sash window and maximised by a palette of earthy colours. One wall is lined with Cole & Son's 'Fornasetti' wallpaper, and a bank of fitted wardrobes has been finished in a vibrant shade of orange. Sliding doors lead to an en suite bathroom, finished entirely in a striking gold and white scheme. The bottom half of the walls are wrapped in brass, which will develop an incredible patina over time; the exterior of the bath, the light fittings and all of the fixtures are finished in the same shade, creating an incredibly striking room.\r<br />\r<br />An additional bedroom suite lies at the far end of the entrance hall. The room has been finished in a beautiful deep blue by Farrow & Ball, creating a tranquil space for sleeping; a further sash window overlooks the front garden, and bespoke cabinetry is built in. An en suite bathroom is finished in stormy grey Venetian plaster, with terracotta tiles on the floor and narrow grey tiles lining the shower.\r<br />\r<br />The Great Outdoors\r<br />\r<br />Externally, a sweeping gravelled driveway leads to the front of the home, where there is a large front lawn and allocated private parking. To the rear, an exceptionally manicured lawn is a secluded respite for residents. There are calm and shaded spots beneath mature trees and beautiful, well-tended flower beds dotted across the garden.\r<br />\r<br />Out and About\u00a0\r<br />\r<br />Birch Lodge is a 15-minute walk from Wimbledon Village, and the immediate local area has an exceptional choice of both independent and large-scale shops and restaurants.

John Soutar, the architect charged with the design of the rest of the property, was also widely respected and was considered responsible for the successful planning and design of the wider Hampstead Garden Suburb. The Suburb was praised for its consistently high standard of design. It remains a highly desirable residential area, with a character defined by its commanding architect-designed properties, lush green spaces and abundance of mature trees.<br /><br />The house is a true thoroughbred in the best traditions of past master builders, rarely seen today. The dignified but unconventional frontage is crafted of the finest handmade grey and red brickwork that gives life to the elevations. Imposing chimney stacks, two niches situated at ground floor level, and a swan\u2019s neck pediment that stands above the front entrance complete the frontage of this imposing Grade II Listed home. The house wears its elegance lightly without striving for effect and without the need for superfluous columns or porticoes. <br /><br />Ingram Avenue is undoubtedly one of the finest roads in this sought-after district of North West London. The rolling acres of Hampstead Heath and Kenwood are located approximately half a kilometre from the property, with Hampstead High Street and Highgate School being equidistant at approximately 2.2 kilometres distance away. Additionally, London Underground stations (Northern Line-Edgware Branch) are available in both Golders Green & Hampstead.<br /><br /><b>Amenities:</b><br />Patio, Garage, Rear Garden", "meta_title": "9 bedroom detached house for sale in Ingram Avenue, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, NW11", "meta_description": "9 bedroom detached house for sale in Ingram Avenue, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, NW11 for \u00a312,500,000.

Perfect for family living with two reception rooms, four large bedrooms, three bath/shower rooms, a large garden, off-road parking, uPVC double glazing and gas central heating.</div><div><br /></div><div>Approaching the property from the quiet, tree-lined residential street, you\u2019ll note that, being set on a bend in the road, the property is offset at a slight angle to its attached neighbour, lending an interesting, quirky feel to the fa\u00e7ade. As would be expected from a property of this type, there are some impressive original architectural details, including an impressive stone mullioned, bay window to the ground and first floors - topped by an impressive gable with intricate carved timber facia boards - with a dramatic porch to match.  There\u2019s a block paved parking area for two vehicles, across which you walk to access the property.</div><div><br /></div><div>Through the dark green timber door with its eye-catching stained glass panels, you\u2019ll find yourself in the spacious hallway which has abundant natural light from the front door, glazed side panels and large transom window above. Original stripped floorboards are complemented by original woodwork to the staircase, door surrounds and doors. Walls are decorated in a cheery duck egg blue and there\u2019s plenty of space for hanging coats and storing shoes. There are also two radiators to guarantee a warm welcome for visitors.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first door to the right takes you into the wonderful main reception room. Benefitting from many original features and lit by natural light from the large bay window, this room has a real sense of grandeur. High ceilings with deep coving are accentuated by the original picture rail, which is painted white above and a classic deep crimson. The impressive cast iron fireplace and mantel, with ornate floral-patterned detail and original inset tiles provides a fabulous centre focus for the room. There are also original stripped floorboards and wood trim to match. The deep bay window which follows the offset angle of the property\u2019s fa\u00e7ade provides a quirky feel to the room and could accommodate a large sofa or a pair of comfortable armchairs, while still leaving plenty of space in the room for more seating, bookcases and an entertainment unit. This is a lovely room for cosy evenings in front of the fire, or for entertaining a group of family and friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Back into the hallway and past the staircase, to the right you\u2019ll find access to the useful cellar storage area, before coming to the next door which leads into the large kitchen and overlooks the side return area of the garden. There are oak-effect base and wall cabinets and drawers, plus full-height storage units which incorporate an integrated double oven and larder. There\u2019s space for a fridge freezer and the original fireplace has additional built-in storage with additional workspace above. There\u2019s also a gas hob, a double stainless steel sink, plumbed-in space for a dishwasher and a large radiator. Floors are a checker-board pattern of stone effect tiles, with the walls painted in a complementary cream, and the room is large enough to accommodate a kitchen table for intimate family dining.</div><div><br /></div><div>Accessed from the kitchen is a large utility room which accommodates a washing machine, a tumble dryer and a large sink, as well as offering plenty of storage and work space. A door leads to the rear garden, which we\u2019ll explore later.</div><div><br /></div><div>We\u2019ll return to the hall now and the final door, at the end, takes us into the second reception room. Currently used as an additional sitting room, this could equally serve as a generous dining room. There\u2019s original coving, stripped floorboards and a gas fire set into the chimney breast and sat on the original tiled hearth, with d\u00e9cor primarily in cream and the chimney breast highlighted in a deep crimson to create a focal point for the room. The room is big enough to accommodate a large dining table and dresser or sideboard, or as is the case currently, has space for comfortable seating, a TV unit and additional storage. Looking out towards the garden is a pair of French windows with matching side panels and transoms which bring natural light into the room via the attached conservatory.</div><div><br /></div><div>Through the French windows, the small conservatory is the perfect location to enjoy views of the southwest facing garden, which benefits from glorious evening sunlight. To the side of the conservatory is a useful downstairs cloakroom, which includes a white two-piece suite comprising of a WC and small handbasin. The floor and walls (to half height) are tiled and there\u2019s also a radiator.</div><div><br /></div><div>From the conservatory, let\u2019s now explore the wonderful private rear garden. There\u2019s a large, flagged terrace which extends to the side return area of the garden and also provides access to a pathway which leads to the front of the property. Beyond the terrace toward the rear of the garden is a substantial raised deck, next to which is a border with mature shrubs and trees. At the very rear of the garden is an additional area which also houses a potting shed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\u2019s return through the ground floor to the hallway and up the stairs to the large split level landing which includes the cleverly integrated stairs to the second floor loft conversion. The landing continues the theme of the hallway with stripped floorboards and wood trim, along with duck egg blue walls.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first room at the top of the stairs is the shower room. A very useful addition in a busy family home, there\u2019s a large glass-panelled shower enclosure, a WC and hand basin set into a large vanity unit with storage and deep shelf above. The floor and walls, again to half height, are tiled in light grey, with a modern darker grey above. There\u2019s natural light from a large window and a combined towel rail and radiator.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next room along is the spacious and stylish main bathroom. White painted timber tongue and groove wainscotting adds a touch of traditional charm and is also used for the bath panel and to clad a built-in storage cupboard. There\u2019s a white three piece bathroom suite comprising of a WC, large pedestal hand basin and bath with a mixer tap and shower attachment centrally mounted. The floor is an attractive mosaic stone effect tile, with walls in a complementary cream. There\u2019s a large radiator, a frosted glass uPVC window and a large wall mounted mirror.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room on this level of the landing is the rear bedroom overlooking the garden. As with all rooms in this property, it\u2019s a very good-sized space which would happily accommodate a double bed, bedside cabinets, wardrobe and additional storage furniture. Once again floors are stripped boards and decoration is light blue walls up to the picture rail and white above. There\u2019s also a radiator below the large uPVC window. </div><div><br /></div><div>Up onto the second level of the landing now and the first door to the right takes us into another bedroom, which overlooks the side return garden. This is another well-proportioned double room and includes an original cast iron fireplace and built-in storage cupboard. Decoration and flooring duplicate the rear bedroom and once again, there\u2019s a large radiator below the window to guarantee a comfortable night\u2019s sleep in the colder months.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room on this level is the impressive main bedroom. Being the full width of the property, this room leaves you in no doubt that this is the principal bedroom. Incorporating both the bay window and the window above the front door, there is abundant natural light, which adds to the feeling of luxurious spaciousness. There\u2019s space for a king size bed, a large run of wardrobes, bedside cabinets, chests of drawers and a dressing table. Original features include original coving and a cast iron fireplace. The bay window would be the perfect location for a touch of decadent opulence, with, perhaps, a large dressing table, a classic chaise longue or a built-in window seat to enjoy a good book or simply watch the world go by. With so much wall and floor space, there\u2019s potential here for a real touch of your own flair with some elegant artwork and vibrant rugs.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now we\u2019ll head up the stairs to the second floor. This staircase and landing are surprisingly bright, with natural light cleverly provided by a large window incorporated into the full width dormer at the rear of the property.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first room on this landing is another shower room, which acts as an en-suite to the bedroom on this level. There\u2019s a glass-panelled shower cubicle, a WC and a large pedestal hand basin. Natural light is provided by a roof window and the floor and walls are fully tiled.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room in this spectacular property is the large bedroom within the attic conversion. The full width dormer allows impressive head height for the majority of the room, with the sloping roof at the other end providing some cosy space, including a delightful hidden corner with its own small roof window. There are full height built-in wardrobes and room for a large double bed, additional storage furniture and some comfortable seating, which gives this space the potential as a parent\u2019s retreat or an amazing teenager\u2019s hideaway.</div><div><br /></div><div>The property is situated in the popular Upper Leytonstone area of London. The immediate vicinity is a peaceful residential area, however all the transport links and amenities of vibrant Leytonstone are just a few minutes away. Leytonstone Central Line Tube Station is a 15 minute walk and several bus routes can be accessed in less than 5 minutes. </div><div><br /></div><div>This area was home to the great Sir Alfred Hitchcock and many local hospitality businesses have used this as their inspiration, including The Rear Window Restaurant, The Birds Pub and The Hitchcock Hotel. Nearby are other pubs, bars and restaurants, including The Olive Greek restaurant, The Aquila Restaurant and the highly rated North Star Pub, which is in the lovely conservation area of Bushwood. There\u2019s a large supermarket within half a mile and many other shops and amenities very close by on the popular High Road Leytonstone.</div><div><br /></div><div>This also a perfect location if you enjoy the great outdoors, as some of London\u2019s best green spaces are close by. Hollow Pond and Leyton Flats are a 5 minute stroll and Wanstead Flats, Hackney Marshes and the Walthamstow Wetlands Nature Reserve are within easy reach. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The owner commented... \u2018This has been a wonderful family home for 16 years and only moving as we are looking to relocate to the North of England for retirement. It is a quiet street with excellent, friendly neighbours on each side of us and across the street, which has given us a real feeling of community. </div><div><br /></div><div>The house is ideally placed for a range of local restaurants, caf\u00e9s in both Leytonstone and Wanstead close by.

It has won over 85 awards for national and international tourism, outstanding architectural quality and engineering achievement. The London Eye is available for corporate events and has become one of the most visited attractions in the UK in 2020. <br /><br />The area of the present South bank was severely damaged during the Second World War, which lead to a major regeneration program. South Bank was chosen as the site for the Festival of Britain to lead this regeneration. The bombed-out riverside was cleared and developed in 1951. The Royal Festival Hall remained as a permanent legacy, and lead an Arts revival which saw the addition of other arts venues, such as the Hayward Gallery and Royal National Theatre, adding a second attraction to the dining and outdoor entrainment.

He used it as a hideaway when London was being bombed by German aircraft.  It was used by Eisenhower because decoy devices were placed within Richmond Park near the Penn Ponds which omitted flames when enemy aircraft were within a six mile range.  They were meant to imply factory sites that had been bombed by earlier raids, thus diverting aeroplanes from authentic targets.<br /><br />However, on 16th August 1940, German bombers raided Malden and Coombe inflicting heavy casualties, with 1,300 houses being damaged and 84 being either totally destroyed or so badly damaged that they had to be demolished.  <br /><br />Telegraph Cottage was later owned by Mrs Gabrielle Keiller who with the Mayor, Councillor Frank Steptoe unveiled a plaque to permanently record General Eisenhower\u2019s stay.<br /><br />Although named Telegraph Cottage, it is unlikely that it was ever used as a message sending point on the relay chain from the Admiralty to Portsmouth.  An earlier semaphore station was situated on what appears to have been later the Coombe Wood Golf Course, according to early maps.  The semaphore station closed following the invention of the Morse Code by the American Samuel F.B Morse (1971-1872).", "meta_title": "8 bedroom detached house for sale in Telegraph Cottage, Warren Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, KT2", "meta_description": "8 bedroom detached house for sale in Telegraph Cottage, Warren Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, KT2 for \u00a39,995,000.

Could this be your next home?<br /><br />\rOverview<br /><br />Positioned on one of the most prestigious residential streets in Wimbledon, West Side Common, Bardon Lodge is a property that is steeped in historical significance. <br /><br />Originally a small cottage for the groom of The Kier, a Grade II listed home on Wimbledon Common, the property underwent a series of extension and development works in the nineteenth century, and during the process, was owned by renowned journalist Walter Bagehot. The property retains much of its quintessential Georgian charm in the present day and yet has since undergone significant renovation works, resulting in the most exquisite of family homes by modern standards. <br /><br />Overlooking the wonderful natural habitat of Wimbledon Common, a sense of privacy and seclusion is immediately apparent, with historic walls and hedging encapsulating the entire boundary. The property can be accessed through two separate entrances, with secure off-street parking available on the driveway or within the garage towards the rear of the house. <br /><br />The property comprises three floors of living accommodation in addition to an original basement cellar. The entrance hall provides a stately introduction to the home. The generously proportioned space features sleek wooden flooring and a bespoke sweeping walnut staircase. An ornate fireplace ensures a warm welcome following the transition from the outdoors on crisp winter mornings for residents and guests alike.<br /><br />As the hub of the home, the kitchen embodies a timeless look conceptualised by the award-winning kitchen designer Martin Moore. Elegant cabinetry is fused with the practicality of a central island, with a convenient array of built-in modern appliances positioned along the walls. The kitchen area works equally well for quality family time as it does for entertaining, with large sliding doors providing a seamless transition to the alfresco dining areas in the garden.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the ground floor of the property is a drawing room, dining room, study, utility room and two downstairs WCs. The neutral colour scheme used throughout the downstairs living quarters and indeed the rest of the home seeks to enhance the abundance of natural light provided by the Gothic arch style windows. However, the most intriguing deviance from this theme awaits in the dining room, which features floor tiles that are believed to originate from the Central lobby in the Palace of Westminster.<br /><br />Heading upstairs to the first floor, four of the property\u2019s six bedrooms can be found. With large bay windows providing multi-angled views over Wimbledon Common, the principal bedroom also features a separate dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. Three further bathrooms are located on the first floor, one of which is an en-suite serving the second bedroom, along with a small family bathroom. This is followed by an additional bathroom which connects to the office space. <br /><br />The second floor of the property contains the fifth and sixth bedrooms along with an additional bathroom and a storage area. As with the office space located on the first floor, the top floor of the property provides an ideal environment in which to work from home in, or offers plenty of potential to be used as a self-contained guest facility, depending on the requirements of the new owners. <br /><br />A mature landscaped garden creates the most serene conclusion to property. A luscious, deep vert lawn surrounds the home and is perfectly punctuated with an array of delicate floral blooms. The space is cleverly zoned with a wall that mimics the architectural style of the main building. Uninterrupted views of the Wimbledon skyline await during the summer months, including truly spectacular sunsets reminiscent of a watercolour landscape. <br /><br />For any property hunters in search of what will no doubt become a treasured family home in an unbeatable location in the heart of Wimbledon, arranging a viewing of Bardon Lodge, West Side Common at the earliest convenience is highly recommended. <br /><br />Location<br /><br />With a look and feel that resembles rural village life yet remains just twenty minutes away from Central London by train, Wimbledon offers a tranquil hidden escape that simply cannot be replicated elsewhere in the city. <br /><br />As an area of London that\u2019s routinely voted as one of the safest areas of the capital to reside in, Wimbledon has something for every property hunter. In particular, many families relocate to Wimbledon due to the quality of life that can be achieved here. Several excellent schools, 42 of which have been rated as \u2018Outstanding\u2019 by Ofsted, can all be found within the local catchment area. <br /><br />Wimbledon Village is a particular draw to residents and visitors alike. Packed with a plethora of independent and high-end shops, alongside restaurants, cafes and pubs, the area is abundant in charm, with a distinct, upscale community feel.<br /><br />Residents have endless open green spaces to explore, including Wimbledon Common, which comprises 1,100 acres of land, alongside nearby Cannizaro Park, Putney Heath and Richmond Park. All of which provide unlimited opportunities for outdoor pursuits from quaint family walks to partaking in popular local sports such as golf and horse riding. <br /><br />Undoubtedly, the most famous sport associated with the area is tennis, with the world-famous Wimbledon tennis tournament happening in the area every year, and in addition, short-term lets during the Wimbledon season can be particularly lucrative to local homeowners. <br /><br />Transport <br /><br />West Side Common is extremely well connected via public transport options, as well as being close to several arterial road networks. The property, therefore offers a prime location for commuting into the city or exploring any of Central London\u2019s amenities with ease. <br /><br />The property is 1.8 miles from A3 giving easy connectivity between Greater London, Surrey and Hampshire. Nearby arterial routes including the A4, A205, M4 and the M25 are all within a short drive away. <br /><br />Wimbledon Tube Station (District Line) is a 1.3 mile drive from the property or a 20-minute walk away. There are frequent service departures towards Edgware Road and High Street Kensington for easy access to additional London Underground lines. <br /><br />Wimbledon Train Station connects with Wimbledon Tube Station. There are frequent direct train services from Wimbledon to London Waterloo, Richmond, St Albans, Woking, Hampton Court, Sutton, Shepperton, Guildford and Dorking. <br /><br />Dundonald Road Tram Stop is 1.2 miles from the property, with services running between Beckenham Junction and Wimbledon. <br /><br />Nearby bus services include 200 (Lambton Road to Mitcham Green Fair) and 93 (Priory Road to Putney Bridge Station).<br /><br />For international travel, Heathrow Airport is 11.3 miles from the property.<br /><br />VIEWINGS - By appointment only with Daniel White from Fine & Country Wimbledon.

A spacious four bedroom, semi-detached Victorian villa in the delightful community of Upper Leytonstone, served by excellent amenities and transport links. Perfect for family living with two reception rooms, four large bedrooms, three bath/shower rooms, a large garden, off-road parking, uPVC double glazing and gas central heating.</div><div><br /></div><div>Approaching the property from the quiet, tree-lined residential street, you\u2019ll note that, being set on a bend in the road, the property is offset at a slight angle to its attached neighbour, lending an interesting, quirky feel to the fa\u00e7ade. As would be expected from a property of this type, there are some impressive original architectural details, including an impressive stone mullioned, bay window to the ground and first floors - topped by an impressive gable with intricate carved timber facia boards - with a dramatic porch to match.  There\u2019s a block paved parking area for two vehicles, across which you walk to access the property.</div><div><br /></div><div>Through the dark green timber door with its eye-catching stained glass panels, you\u2019ll find yourself in the spacious hallway which has abundant natural light from the front door, glazed side panels and large transom window above. Original stripped floorboards are complemented by original woodwork to the staircase, door surrounds and doors. Walls are decorated in a cheery duck egg blue and there\u2019s plenty of space for hanging coats and storing shoes. There are also two radiators to guarantee a warm welcome for visitors.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first door to the right takes you into the wonderful main reception room. Benefitting from many original features and lit by natural light from the large bay window, this room has a real sense of grandeur. High ceilings with deep coving are accentuated by the original picture rail, which is painted white above and a classic deep crimson. The impressive cast iron fireplace and mantel, with ornate floral-patterned detail and original inset tiles provides a fabulous centre focus for the room. There are also original stripped floorboards and wood trim to match. The deep bay window which follows the offset angle of the property\u2019s fa\u00e7ade provides a quirky feel to the room and could accommodate a large sofa or a pair of comfortable armchairs, while still leaving plenty of space in the room for more seating, bookcases and an entertainment unit. This is a lovely room for cosy evenings in front of the fire, or for entertaining a group of family and friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>Back into the hallway and past the staircase, to the right you\u2019ll find access to the useful cellar storage area, before coming to the next door which leads into the large kitchen and overlooks the side return area of the garden. There are oak-effect base and wall cabinets and drawers, plus full-height storage units which incorporate an integrated double oven and larder. There\u2019s space for a fridge freezer and the original fireplace has additional built-in storage with additional workspace above. There\u2019s also a gas hob, a double stainless steel sink, plumbed-in space for a dishwasher and a large radiator. Floors are a checker-board pattern of stone effect tiles, with the walls painted in a complementary cream, and the room is large enough to accommodate a kitchen table for intimate family dining.</div><div><br /></div><div>Accessed from the kitchen is a large utility room which accommodates a washing machine, a tumble dryer and a large sink, as well as offering plenty of storage and work space. A door leads to the rear garden, which we\u2019ll explore later.</div><div><br /></div><div>We\u2019ll return to the hall now and the final door, at the end, takes us into the second reception room. Currently used as an additional sitting room, this could equally serve as a generous dining room. There\u2019s original coving, stripped floorboards and a gas fire set into the chimney breast and sat on the original tiled hearth, with d\u00e9cor primarily in cream and the chimney breast highlighted in a deep crimson to create a focal point for the room. The room is big enough to accommodate a large dining table and dresser or sideboard, or as is the case currently, has space for comfortable seating, a TV unit and additional storage. Looking out towards the garden is a pair of French windows with matching side panels and transoms which bring natural light into the room via the attached conservatory.</div><div><br /></div><div>Through the French windows, the small conservatory is the perfect location to enjoy views of the southwest facing garden, which benefits from glorious evening sunlight. To the side of the conservatory is a useful downstairs cloakroom, which includes a white two-piece suite comprising of a WC and small handbasin. The floor and walls (to half height) are tiled and there\u2019s also a radiator.</div><div><br /></div><div>From the conservatory, let\u2019s now explore the wonderful private rear garden. There\u2019s a large, flagged terrace which extends to the side return area of the garden and also provides access to a pathway which leads to the front of the property. Beyond the terrace toward the rear of the garden is a substantial raised deck, next to which is a border with mature shrubs and trees. At the very rear of the garden is an additional area which also houses a potting shed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let\u2019s return through the ground floor to the hallway and up the stairs to the large split level landing which includes the cleverly integrated stairs to the second floor loft conversion. The landing continues the theme of the hallway with stripped floorboards and wood trim, along with duck egg blue walls.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first room at the top of the stairs is the shower room. A very useful addition in a busy family home, there\u2019s a large glass-panelled shower enclosure, a WC and hand basin set into a large vanity unit with storage and deep shelf above. The floor and walls, again to half height, are tiled in light grey, with a modern darker grey above. There\u2019s natural light from a large window and a combined towel rail and radiator.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next room along is the spacious and stylish main bathroom. White painted timber tongue and groove wainscotting adds a touch of traditional charm and is also used for the bath panel and to clad a built-in storage cupboard. There\u2019s a white three piece bathroom suite comprising of a WC, large pedestal hand basin and bath with a mixer tap and shower attachment centrally mounted. The floor is an attractive mosaic stone effect tile, with walls in a complementary cream. There\u2019s a large radiator, a frosted glass uPVC window and a large wall mounted mirror.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room on this level of the landing is the rear bedroom overlooking the garden. As with all rooms in this property, it\u2019s a very good-sized space which would happily accommodate a double bed, bedside cabinets, wardrobe and additional storage furniture. Once again floors are stripped boards and decoration is light blue walls up to the picture rail and white above. There\u2019s also a radiator below the large uPVC window. </div><div><br /></div><div>Up onto the second level of the landing now and the first door to the right takes us into another bedroom, which overlooks the side return garden. This is another well-proportioned double room and includes an original cast iron fireplace and built-in storage cupboard. Decoration and flooring duplicate the rear bedroom and once again, there\u2019s a large radiator below the window to guarantee a comfortable night\u2019s sleep in the colder months.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room on this level is the impressive main bedroom. Being the full width of the property, this room leaves you in no doubt that this is the principal bedroom. Incorporating both the bay window and the window above the front door, there is abundant natural light, which adds to the feeling of luxurious spaciousness. There\u2019s space for a king size bed, a large run of wardrobes, bedside cabinets, chests of drawers and a dressing table. Original features include original coving and a cast iron fireplace. The bay window would be the perfect location for a touch of decadent opulence, with, perhaps, a large dressing table, a classic chaise longue or a built-in window seat to enjoy a good book or simply watch the world go by. With so much wall and floor space, there\u2019s potential here for a real touch of your own flair with some elegant artwork and vibrant rugs.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now we\u2019ll head up the stairs to the second floor. This staircase and landing are surprisingly bright, with natural light cleverly provided by a large window incorporated into the full width dormer at the rear of the property.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first room on this landing is another shower room, which acts as an en-suite to the bedroom on this level. There\u2019s a glass-panelled shower cubicle, a WC and a large pedestal hand basin. Natural light is provided by a roof window and the floor and walls are fully tiled.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final room in this spectacular property is the large bedroom within the attic conversion. The full width dormer allows impressive head height for the majority of the room, with the sloping roof at the other end providing some cosy space, including a delightful hidden corner with its own small roof window. There are full height built-in wardrobes and room for a large double bed, additional storage furniture and some comfortable seating, which gives this space the potential as a parent\u2019s retreat or an amazing teenager\u2019s hideaway.</div><div><br /></div><div>The property is situated in the popular Upper Leytonstone area of London. The immediate vicinity is a peaceful residential area, however all the transport links and amenities of vibrant Leytonstone are just a few minutes away. Leytonstone Central Line Tube Station is a 15 minute walk and several bus routes can be accessed in less than 5 minutes. </div><div><br /></div><div>This area was home to the great Sir Alfred Hitchcock and many local hospitality businesses have used this as their inspiration, including The Rear Window Restaurant, The Birds Pub and The Hitchcock Hotel. Nearby are other pubs, bars and restaurants, including The Olive Greek restaurant, The Aquila Restaurant and the highly rated North Star Pub, which is in the lovely conservation area of Bushwood. There\u2019s a large supermarket within half a mile and many other shops and amenities very close by on the popular High Road Leytonstone.</div><div><br /></div><div>This also a perfect location if you enjoy the great outdoors, as some of London\u2019s best green spaces are close by. Hollow Pond and Leyton Flats are a 5 minute stroll and Wanstead Flats, Hackney Marshes and the Walthamstow Wetlands Nature Reserve are within easy reach. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The owner commented... \u2018This has been a wonderful family home for 16 years and only moving as we are looking to relocate to the North of England for retirement. It is a quiet street with excellent, friendly neighbours on each side of us and across the street, which has given us a real feeling of community. </div><div><br /></div><div>The house is ideally placed for a range of local restaurants, caf\u00e9s in both Leytonstone and Wanstead close by. We are also lucky to have so much green space around us, with Hollow Pond which is the edge of Epping Forest at the top of the road providing plenty of options for walks and cycling. </div><div><br /></div><div>We are 20 minutes away for Central London via tube, with the M11 only 5 minutes away to head towards Stansted with City Airport also within easy reach\u2019. </div><div><br /></div><div>To view this property, please contact a member of our friendly and helpful team of property professionals. </div><div><br /></div><div><strong>MATERIAL INFORMATION</strong></div><div>Tenure - Freehold</div><div>Council tax band - E</div><div><br /></div><div>These property particulars have been prepared by Trading Places Estate and Letting Agents under the instruction of the owner and shall not constitute an offer or the basis of any contract.

This particular apartment unfurls over almost 1,700 sq ft, with two large bedrooms and an enormous south-facing terrace. It combines a rich palette of materials with unfaltering attention to detail, brilliantly considered spatial design and sublime injections of light throughout.\r<br />\r<br />The Building\r<br />\r<br />The development lies within the Fitzjohn\u2019s and Netherhall Conservation Area and is situated next to and overlooking the 1960s-era St Thomas More Church. The building itself was built c.1870 as a large detached house on an unusually broad plot. It was the only building on the street until the 1960s, when the adjacent Church was built, the first building on the east side of the street. The fa\u00e7ade follows the model found in the grand villas of Fitzjohn\u2019s Avenue, with a projecting square bay and the red brick characteristic of the area.\r<br />\r<br />The Tour\r<br />\r<br />The building is approached from Maresfield Gardens and is set far back from the quiet residential street, behind a front garden of Corten-framed beds and exquisite planting. Steps ascend to the raised ground foyer of the communal entrance.\r<br />\r<br />The apartment is located on the second floor and is accessed by stairs or via a keyed lift that opens directly to each of the apartments on the upper levels. The leather-lined elevator opens through brass-clad doors, leading west to the bedrooms and east to the receptions and living spaces.\r<br />\r<br />Engineered oak in a light, chevron pattern extends through much of the apartment, and underfloor heating is present throughout. The hallway turns right toward the breakfast room, with one of two entry points to the kitchen on the left. Dark wood panelling clads the walls from the entrance through to this intimate extension of the kitchen, where bespoke joinery forms partitioning bookshelves and two sets of casement windows pour changing light into the space throughout the day.\r<br />\r<br />The kitchen is positioned to the left of the plan and is cleverly arranged in an L-shape, allowing the bulk of storage to exist in one length, while pale yellow Carrara marble worktops are set against a smoked-mirror backsplash in the working portion. The kitchen is by Boffi and contains appliances by Gaggenau and Miele and is lit by a single window at the far end.\r<br />\r<br />Beyond the breakfast room lies the reception, a sprawling open room with a living space under two sash windows at one end and a raised fireplace with a stunning travertine surround. At the other end is a dining space with French doors that open onto a substantial terrace.\r<br />\r<br />The two bedrooms are positioned at the front of the building on the opposite side of the hallway. Entry to the larger of the bedrooms is through an intriguing curved walkway. A bank of built-in joinery lines one wall, and a pair of high sash windows within the bay look onto the foliage of the tree-lined avenue. An en suite shower room is set to the right upon entry.\r<br />\r<br />The principal bedroom is also filled with light from two sash windows and benefits from built-in joinery along one wall as well as a dressing space to the rear. At the far end of the room, double doors open to the bathroom, which incorporates a separate shower, bath and double sinks. Both bathrooms are clad in Arabascata marble from Salvatori and have brass fixtures by Vola.\r<br />\r<br />All apartments in the development have been acoustically treated and are equipped with Crestron and Lutron Smart Home technology, and all are fully air-conditioned. They are also wired for electric blinds and curtains, remote monitoring and AV.\r<br />\r<br />Outdoor Space\r<br />\r<br />From the dining area in the main reception, glazed double doors open onto the paved terrace, which benefits from uninterrupted southern and westerly aspects. A perimeter of box hedging enhances the already existing privacy, and views across to the high-level glazing of St Thomas More church can be enjoyed.\r<br />\r<br />The Area\r<br />\r<br />Maresfield Gardens is a quiet residential street, well situated for access to the shops, restaurants and Underground station in Hampstead Village, as well as the open spaces of Hampstead Heath. The shops and cafes on England\u2019s Lane are within easy reach, as are the delights of Primrose Hill and the beautiful Regent\u2019s Park to the south.\r<br />\r<br />Many of London\u2019s best independent schools are within a short walk of the house, including the Hall, St Antony\u2019s, South Hampstead, St Christopher\u2019s, Trevor Roberts and Sarum Hall.\r<br />\r<br />Within five minutes\u2019 walk are Finchley Road Underground Station (Jubilee & Metropolitan Lines), Hampstead (Northern Line) and Finchley Road & Frognal London Overground Station.\r<br />\r<br />Tenure: Share of Leasehold\r<br />Lease Length: approx. 999 years remaining\r<br />Service Charge: approx. \u00a38,500 per annum\r<br />Ground Rent: Peppercorn\r<br />Council Tax Band:", "meta_title": "2 bedroom flat for sale in Maresfield Gardens II, London NW3", "meta_description": "2 bedroom flat for sale in Maresfield Gardens II, London NW3 for \u00a33,250,000.

This large, imposing building along the Thames at Barnes has long been a landmark for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat race and was designed to mirror the famous Harrods department store in Knightsbridge. This grand building by the banks of the river was completed in 1913 and designed using red brick and terracotta, featuring baroque style themes with strong horizontal lines and the prominent cupolas. An additional long wing was added in 1920, with a similar wing planned for the north side that was never completed.<br /> <br />The former warehouse building was particularly noteworthy because of the reinforced cantilevers either side of the lift shaft, which assisted in its gaining Grade II listed status in 1990.<br /> <br />The historic Harrods buildings were converted into apartments in 1997-99 with the old soap factory renamed Charles Harrod Building after the former owner of Harrods department store. The former candle factory was renamed Richard Burbidge Buildings in honour of the former managing director of Harrods. The later grand building by the river was officially named William Hunt Mansions in honour of architect W.G. Hunt and officially opened in spring 1999.<br /> <br />Location / Transport / Schooling \u2013 <br /> <br />Barnes is surrounded on three sides by the River Thames, providing lovely walks, and has the world famous London Wetlands centre.

It was built around 1720 in the Queen Anne style and is a beautiful example of a fine early 18th-century townhouse. Set over six characterful levels, it has four bedrooms and a versatile plan measuring almost 3,800 sq ft internally. Additionally, there is a private south-facing walled garden to the rear, leading discretely to a separate garage. Incredibly, the house has retained all of its original architectural features, which are now waiting to be revealed and celebrated. There is great potential to improve the home further, and as such, it will require some updating.\r<br />\r<br />Setting the Scene\r<br />\r<br />Hampstead was granted to the Benedictine monks of Westminster Abbey by charter in AD 986, and it is believed that a church was placed on Church Row not long after. The beautiful Grade I-listed St John at Hampstead still stands on this spot in the centre of the street. Church Row\u2019s local importance is well documented; Pevsner Architectural Guides describes it as \u2018the best street in Hampstead\u2019. For more information, please see the History section.\r<br />\r<br />The Grand Tour\r<br />\r<br />Set behind original cast-iron railings with urn finials, the house is made of brown brick with red brick dressings. The fa\u00e7ade is punctuated with large box sash windows and crowned with a slated mansard roof. The doorcase is thought to be a late Georgian addition, comprised of a fluted surround and a round-arched doorway with pilaster jambs; a radial patterned fanlight sits above the six-panel entrance door.\r<br />\r<br />The door opens immediately to the wide private entrance hall, which features the first glimpse of the sense of history, beauty and elegance that permeates the entire home. Raised and fielded panelling incorporates a dado rail and box cornice above, and a fluted pilaster archway leads to the broader staircase hall. Here, a grand staircase has wide treads and hand-turned barley twist balusters. The outstanding architectural features include further panelling and box cornicing on most floors, with beautiful joinery, fire surrounds, box sash windows with shutters, and pitch pine floorboards.\r<br />\r<br />The ground floor is currently configured with a spacious dining room to the front of the plan, with the kitchen opening directly from here. Both rooms are fully panelled and feature beautiful fireplaces, inset with faience Delft-style tiles. The dining room has a lovely low light, almost Dutch in quality. The next-door kitchen is remarkably bright and features panelled cabinetry complementing the Georgian panelling. There is a WC at the plan's rear and separate garden access.\r<br />\r<br />The first floor is home to the bipartite drawing room. Here, the two areas are easily separated by original folding doors in a handsome architrave. Light floods the room from north and south, with a trio of full-height sash windows to the front. This floor has exceptional ceiling heights and an incredible feeling of space. Panelling features ovolo mouldings with beautiful fireplaces in both areas. The adjoined rear \u2018closet\u2019 space is set in an unusual, canted bay and makes for a charming separate reading area overlooking the garden.\r<br />\r<br />The second floor is entirely given over to the principal bedroom suite. Sleeping quarters are set to the rear and open to a spacious dressing room; next door is the en suite bathroom. Ovolo-moulded panelling continues in the floor\u2019s three rooms, with a beautiful fireplace in the bedroom. On the third floor are two further bedrooms, with horizontal boarding to dado height and a bathroom. The back bedroom enjoys brilliant views of central London through an unusual heraldic glass casement window set into the canted bay. The uppermost floor is a garret of sorts and forms the fourth compartmented bedroom, enjoying the very best views in the entire house.\r<br />\r<br />Two further spacious rooms are set below the stairs on the lower-ground floor. Both have quarry tiles running underfoot and large open hearths. A bathroom and separate laundry area are set to the rear. The front room opens to the exterior lightwell, running the width of the house; it also has independent access from the street. Two deep vaults run under the pavement, making for excellent storage space or wine cellars.\r<br />\r<br />A private walkway is concealed behind a secure rear gate in the garden, leading to the garage on Perrin\u2019s Walk.\r<br />\r<br />The Great Outdoors\r<br />\r<br />The glorious south-facing walled garden is a quiet oasis in the heart of bustle of Hampstead Village. Exceptionally peaceful, the York stone terrace is a welcome sunny spot for outdoor seating, complemented by wisteria climbing the walls. A lawn surrounded by mature shrubs and an old mulberry tree leads to a secondary stone terrace positioned under trees to enjoy the shade on hot summer days.\r<br />\r<br />Out and About\r<br />\r<br />The house is just a few minutes' walk from the delights that make Hampstead one of the most sought-after locations in London.

This is the type of property \r<br />that allows one to truly exhale and feel at home. The warm reminders of history within \r<br />the antiquities of small details throughout the home, such as cornicing and original \r<br />woodwork. \r<br />We have added modern touches throughout, to enjoy the luxury of heritage alongside the \r<br />utility and accessibility of modern technology. We found this to be a fine balance of \r<br />creating an eclectic London home and furnishing the rooms to feel like a Pied-a-terr\u00e9; \r<br />each room provides a sanctuary for any mood.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What are the neighbours like? \r<br />Many of our neighbours are full-time residents of the property and are either \r<br />professionals, at leisure or busy in some regard! We have always enjoyed the delight of our \r<br />neighbours and have found some lifelong friends in this building. Purchasing a home, \r<br />especially such as this, is not simply a key and 4 walls, it's a lifestyle.\r<br />\r<br />What attracted you to this specific house and location? \r<br />The home is beautifully elevated above street level, with the ground feeling near but \r<br />privacy is never far. We live on a classical boulevard, something that is usually seen in \r<br />continental Europe and was unfortunately abolished in London, to make way for tighter \r<br />construction at the turn of the century. \r<br />In addition to the home itself, we benefitted from amazing schooling facilities, both public \r<br />and private, alongside the amenities of Central London, while one can hear a pin-drop on \r<br />our docile street. \r<br />\r<br />what would you like to tell parents about the benefits of raising children here? \r<br />The area is safe, quiet and secure. There are many open, green spaces within walking \r<br />distance, and there is a restaurant and cafe for every need, regardless of how fussy \r<br />toddlers can be. The option to live beautifully is something that always adds a sense of \r<br />ease to raising one's children and with the strong presence of schools in the area, there is \r<br />a luxury of choice for your child. \r<br />\r<br />What made you choose this property over the other the others that were available? \r<br />This property had a unique layout, alongside the exciting opportunity to buy into London's \r<br />true heritage, with history under every floorboard and in every ceiling column. The \r<br />property felt warm, private and snug, while benefiting from a great square-footage, \r<br />amazing natural light and wide, open rooms for entertainment and family living. \r<br />\r<br />How convenient is it for commuting from here? \r<br />If you're a die-hard Londoner, the tube will be your best-friend during your tenure in this \r<br />busy city. With Notting-Hill gate and Queensway stations within walking distance, busstops planted throughout the streets and Uber available within 5 minutes at any given \r<br />time, this is the true meaning of living within the beating heart of a city. Transport has \r<br />always been something that attracted us to this particular area in Central London. Our \r<br />children could easily begin their independent lives, safely and with ease. Alongside this, \r<br />on the unfortunate occasion our car broke down, we always had a plan-B. \r<br />What can you tell us about the history of the property and how it has been adapted by \r<br />\r<br />Who do you think would be the ideal next owner? \r<br />Someone that appreciates serenity after a long-day. A family looking to expand or to \r<br />settle. A couple that have a passion for homes, that wish to create their story within the \r<br />walls of this beautiful home. I believe that this property can adapt to the owner, not the \r<br />other way around. Typically, we have to throw away our lives to move into a new home, \r<br />but I believe this home is given it's character by the personal touches of its inhabitant. \r<br />I am so dearly excited for this home's next chapter. \r<br />\r<br />What changes have you made to the house since you've owned it? \r<br />We have worked primarily on bathrooms, kitchens and maintenance of the home. We \r<br />wanted to ensure that history and heritage is preserved in a way that is meaningful. We \r<br />have tried to keep all of our design work as simplistic and minimal as possible, as to not \r<br />interfere with the integrity of the original design. \r<br />\r<br />What's your favourite room and why? \r<br />The dining room is the heart of the home. Classically styled, this home allows for large \r<br />dinner parties, roaring into the wee hours. With beautiful candle-lit settings, alongside a \r<br />central mast for only the most beautiful chandelier, even a small get-together can end up \r<br />being the talk of the town.\r<br />\r<br />What do you love about the house the most now? \r<br />It's ability to stun any newcomer to the apartment. When one first steps foot into the \r<br />home, it feels almost magical and provides a sense of real history, with adaptations of art, \r<br />cultural references and unique design choices, spoiling the eye of any guest.\r<br />\r<br />What do you love about the local community? \r<br />The sense of neighbourly care. The ability to talk to your neighbours without fearing that \r<br />you'll seem intrusive. The casual hello on the way to morning coffee, or the catch-up with \r<br />a family who are just entering their first years of little feet and nursery trips. I truly think \r<br />that this environment and area, are the British charm of living in London.\r<br />\r<br />Why have you decided to move on? \r<br />Now that our children have grown up, we find ourselves looking for something slightly \r<br />smaller, and perhaps something that fits the lifestyle we find ourselves more commonly \r<br />living, as our positions have changed since our first days in this beautiful apartment. If we \r<br />could do it all over again, one can safely say, we'd still pick this home to be the one in \r<br />which, we celebrated each birthday, each holiday and every milestone moment until this \r<br />one, where we will find our new beginning.\r<br />\r<br />Palace Court is a handsome red brick period mansion block situated on a quiet residential street in the heart of W2.

Built in 1876 in the Dutch revival style, the house is laid out over five levels, with internal accommodation extending to almost 3,500 sq ft. Wonderfully preserved and restored, an exceptional level of finish has been achieved throughout. Contemporary interventions echo elements of the past and blend beautifully with the original plan. There is also a captivating and private west-facing terraced garden positioned to the rear of the house. Both the King's Road and Chelsea are close. More locally, the amenities of Battersea Park Road and the newly opened Battersea Power Station, home to countless fashionable shops, restaurants and entertainment, is a short walk away on foot.\r<br />\r<br />Setting the Scene\r<br />\r<br />This house and the 13-house terrace it sits within have been wonderfully preserved as part of the protected conservation area. The fa\u00e7ades have been kept completely intact as a fine example of relatively restrained mid-Victorian domestic architecture. However, recent exhaustive renovations have wholly reimagined the spaces within this grand Victorian residence using the finest materials and architectural elements while retaining the integrity of the original building's conception.\r<br />\r<br />The finish and attention to detail are exquisite, with a bold sense of texture, materiality and colour. The kitchen and service areas have been retained at the lower-ground level, with the addition of spacious open-plan family quarters. The ground floor contains beautiful reception spaces, while the first floor comprises the principal bedroom suite, with further bedrooms set above.\r<br />\r<br />The Grand Tour\r<br />\r<br />Set behind a low brick wall, the electric remote-operated entrance gate opens to a private courtyard garden, laid with antique stone setts in a circular pattern, surrounded by mature shrubs. The house is made of red brick laid in Flemish bond, with a Dutch gable roof; the fa\u00e7ade is punctuated with original box sash windows, and a decorative cast-iron Juliet balcony spans the width of the piano nobile. Bike storage is contained at the side of the front garden, and a separate service entrance leads to the lower-ground floor. Newly reinstated Portland stone steps lead up to the main entrance, and a canopied porch is inset with the original design six-panel pillar-box red front door.\r<br />\r<br />The entrance hall hints at the richness that defines the decoration of this home. Walls are papered in Arte\u2019s Belgian linen design in burnt orange with fielded wainscotting set below. The wide set staircase lies directly ahead and is carpeted in hand-woven 'Peacock' coir matting by Sinclair Till. Architectural hardware throughout the house, including all door furniture and electric plates, is finished in antique brass, and all the fixed joinery in the home is bespoke.\r<br />\r<br />Oak parquet flooring leads to a large double-width architrave and the bipartite living and dining room. Here, the seating area is set to the front of the plan with brilliant views over the park through the canted bay window. Beautiful cornicing has been reintroduced, and there are two specially commissioned stone chimneypieces in a contemporary pronounced bolection design, each fitted for gas fires. A wall of bespoke bookshelves separates the living space from the dining area at the back, where glass cabinets and shelving are set into the alcoves.\r<br />\r<br />From here, glass wedding doors open to the spacious study area. Contemporary interventions in this room include a glass aperture on the floor looking down to the snug below, a glass mono-pitch roof, and a full-height roundhead sectional window looking out to the garden. A wall of intricately framed mirrored cupboards is set along one wall; there is a guest WC to the very rear.\r<br />\r<br />The lower-ground floor is a brilliantly conceived part of the house. Comprising three distinct main spaces, it totals some 45 feet in length. There is also a separate utility area, entrance hall, cloakroom and a WC. This floor is resolutely the heart of the home, with a dining area at the front of the plan and a window seat set into the bay window. An exquisite monolithic honed Paonazza marble chimneypiece creates a focal point in the room, balanced by glass dressers set into the alcoves.\r<br />\r<br />The kitchen is positioned in the centre of the plan, designed around a central island unit inset with a sink and Quooker mixer tap. Generously thick-cut slabs of Silestone in a textured volcano finish rest atop custom built oak veneer cabinetry. Appliances, including a fridge-freezer and dishwasher, are concealed behind the cupboards, and a Rangemaster stove is set along one wall. The wide oak floorboards were specially chosen in a warm grey tone to complement the tonality of the cabinetry and stone worktops, creating a harmonious and tactile effect. At the rear is the informal snug area, with a full-height glass aperture and separate folding glass doors that open to the garden and flood the space with light.\r<br />\r<br />The first floor is home to the principal bedroom suite, painted plaster pink. Here, two sets of French windows open to the Juliet balcony with vistas of the trees and parkland. A wall of lattice-framed mirrored wardrobing is painted a deep blue, and there is an original chimneypiece with a cast-iron grate set into the hearth. Discretely positioned behind is the spacious closet and en suite bathroom. Here, double sinks are set into a beautiful vanity unit; there is an infrared sauna, a shower area and a large freestanding bateau slipper bath beside the window. Brassware is nickel plated.\r<br />\r<br />There is an additional bedroom and en suite shower room at the rear of this floor and four further bedrooms with brilliant, colourful, contemporary bathrooms on the upper floors.\r<br />\r<br />The Great Outdoors\r<br />\r<br />The rear garden is west-facing and enjoys sunlight during the best part of the day. The terracotta brick-laid terrace has a beautiful patina, with the stones especially imported from Italy. In conjunction with the Victorian wall-mounted fountain, both lend a sense of antiquity to this exterior space. The seating area comprises built-in benches, which can accommodate a large outdoor dining table. The southern elevation here is fully mirrored, allowing for an increased sense of space and depth.\r<br />\r<br />A set of steps ascend to a separate upper terrace, shaded by a wonderfully mature tree; each garden on the terrace has a unique tree in the same spot, which was planted by the developer when the houses were first built. Currently utilised as a children\u2019s play area, this terrace could also be used as an additional seating area if required. There is also exterior storage set under the steps.\r<br />\r<br />Out and About\r<br />\r<br />This house is within easy reach of the shops, restaurants and general amenities of the King's Road and Chelsea, as well as, more locally, the countless provisors and cafes of Battersea Park Road and Battersea Square. The Prince Albert on Albert Bridge Road is an excellent local pub, offering a comfortingly familiar menu. The gourmet grocer Bayley and Sage is located on Parkgate Street, close to acclaimed restaurant Nutbourne at Ransome\u2019s Dock; both are just a two-minute walk away. The development of Nine Elms is nearby, as well as the incredible Battersea Power Station\u00a0reached on foot through the park, and now home to an excellent array of high-end shops, restaurants and a cinema.\r<br />\r<br />Battersea Park is directly across from Albert Bridge Road and spans 200 acres. Laid out between 1854 and 1870 and Grade II*-listed, the park has an extensive frontage and riverside promenade to the Thames. Wide, tree-lined avenues meander around a large boating lake and through open lawned areas, with notable trees, children\u2019s play areas, a children\u2019s zoo, the Pump House gallery and sports facilities. The Pear Tree Cafe is set beside the lake and offers vibrant evenings of live music, with food by ex-Petersham Nurseries alumni Annabel Partridge and Will Burrett.\r<br />\r<br />There are plenty of schools locally for all ages, including the excellent Newton Prep School and Thomas\u2019s School, while excellent independent day schools are located nearby Chelsea.\r<br />\r<br />The closest train stations are Battersea Park and Queenstown Road, just over 15 minutes by foot, and there is a new extension to the Northern Line at Battersea Power Station, five minutes\u2019 walk through the park. Buses run regularly to Victoria station from Cadogan Pier, just across Albert Bridge, while also from the pier is the Thames Clipper Uber boat, offering connecting river services to the City and Canary Wharf to the East.\r<br />\r<br />Council Tax Band: G", "meta_title": "6 bedroom terraced house for sale in Albert Bridge Road, London SW11", "meta_description": "6 bedroom terraced house for sale in Albert Bridge Road, London SW11 for \u00a36,250,000.

Turning onto Kenmont Gardens suddenly transports you to a quiet enclave in the middle of bustling West London and the property is perfectly located for security and seclusion. Upon closing the front door of St Jude`s House occupants will find themselves in a haven of light, space and tranquillity. <br />However, it is also right on the doorstep of the amenities of Kensal Rise. This epic home is a few minutes` walk from Kensal Green tube station and a mile from Chamberlayne Road, which has a `fine selection of independent cafes, delis, pubs and shops. Even more tempting is the proximity to central London. It is a 10-minute drive to Notting Hill and 15-minute journey to Marylebone. <br />The current owners have thoroughly enjoyed the access to the life, culture and the amenities of London but always with the knowledge they can retreat into the calm and serenity of St Jude`s. <br />The 19th century Gothic church underwent a respectful yet transformative restoration and conversion programme lasting 18 months and resulting in a four-bedroom home with vast voluminous spaces and soaring ceiling heights. The main living areas sit within the vast central hall, framed by a series of equilateral ecclesiastical arches and illuminated by stain glass windows, it opens out onto a central courtyard garden which provides additional breathing space. <br /><br />An elegant Italian-tiled floor leads from the grand entrance hall of inspiring proportions to a guest cloakroom before flowing into the bespoke bronze spiral staircase which curls up to a galleried study in the rafters. This ultimate working-from-home space takes in the architectural wonder of the roof and structure of the former church and overlooks the extensive living area below. The perfect environment to nurture creativity and productivity. <br />Although open plan to maximise natural light, the living area is zoned in a natural and clever way to provide both flexibility and purpose. The large-scale kitchen made by Rupert Bevan uses the most cutting-edge and fashionable materials, in a classic way and in keeping with the building`s heritage. It has polished concrete tops and zinc-clad cabinetry and is made for entertaining \u2013 formal or informal. There is a secondary kitchen too with a pantry. <br />This rarified living space is further enhanced by solid oak parquet flooring, working marble fireplaces with herringbone brickwork and a sociable dining area at one end.<br />The master bedroom sits on the top floor, with a vaulted ceiling and is flooded with natural light. There are two dressing rooms and an incredible en-suite with shower and free-standing bath with views from a collection of three arched glass windows. The bronze staircase, beneath another stained-glass window, leads to two more family bedrooms, on the first floor, with large en-suite bathrooms, and a guest bedroom on the ground floor, also with an en suite bathroom. <br />In addition, there is a versatile, multi-purpose room which is currently designed as a gym but could form a second home study, mindfulness studio or another bedroom. <br />The vision was immaculately curated by the high-end interior designer Harriet Holgate who has sympathetically coupled heritage Victorian architecture with modern technology. <br />The property will greatly appreciate in value in line with the wave of regeneration that is sweeping across the West London corridor, although St Jude`s House is a safe distance from any physical transformation that is underway. <br />To the south is Wood Lane and the revitalised White City. The recent renovation of the BBC Television Centre has triggered the explosion of independent restaurants and bars and the arrival of the new Soho House members` club. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Notice</b><br />Please note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.
