The well-appointed dual aspect kitchen maintains the clean lines, light and minimalist character of the entire property. A bespoke sleek worktop and low-profile backsplash is tiled throughout in \u2018Hampton White\u2019 tiles, from the historic British ceramic producer Johnson Tiles; a playful and stylish reinterpretation of the maisonette\u2019s 1970s origins. Allowing for the largest preparation workspace, a large freestanding dual fuel modern range cooker is the only large visible appliance on display. The fridge and freezer are all integrated beneath the worktop. Generous storage is provided under the kitchen counter via two large articulated corner cupboards, whilst space under the property\u2019s stairs has been cleverly converted into a kitchen pantry. With large floor to ceiling windows across the entire back wall of the property, the lounge is flooded with natural light. This living area provides direct access to a charming private patio, as well as onto the Estate\u2019s beautifully maintained communal gardens.<br><br>On the first floor, you will find your two double bedrooms, the family bathroom, as well as a utility/ laundry room. This 1st floor accommodation is accessed via a reconditioned wooden staircase; one that is partially screened by the property\u2019s stylish full-height original square-edged spindles. Leading up to a bright 1st floor hallway, this upper landing benefits from a newly installed reeded glass-block wall. This then leads you onto your well-proportioned 2nd bedroom, which features windows extending the full width of the room and is comparably as large as the master bedroom. The utility room is next door, this useful extra room is currently being used as a self-contained laundry and storage space. As well as housing the washing machine for the property, the room has been fitted with slimline multipurpose wall storage, shelving and peg boards. Next, the bathroom is entered via a pocket door, making the room unusually spacious. Sleek with stylish touches throughout, matte-black furnishings and a playful pink hand basin accent the fully tiled room. Clever use of the same tiles as the kitchen worktop area has created a sense of harmony between the upper and lower living areas in the property. A large walk-in \u2018rainfall\u2019 style shower extends the full depth of the room, whilst the opposite wall houses a Clearwater lavatory with concealed cistern, a floating hand basin shelf, and a heated mirror illuminated by additional wall lights. Completing the accommodation is the generous master bedroom. An innovative curtain rail allows the full-length curtains to be moved onto the bedhead wall and away from the window area entirely, ensuring light is always maximised in the room. An original 1974 fanlight above the bedroom door adds to the light and airy feel of the room, whilst a cleverly concealed inbuilt floor-to-ceiling cupboard provides extra bedroom storage.<br><br>Sylvan Road is within a short walking distance of the restaurants, pubs and amenities of Crystal Palace\u2019s iconic Triangle. Direct transport links into Central London via London Victoria, London Bridge and Canada Water, are provided via Crystal Palace Station.

Walk down the historic \"stairs\" from the development and discover the sandy beaches and the soothing sound of the tide, which creates a relaxing holiday feel.<br><br>Enjoy the unique village atmosphere of Wapping; a hidden gem conveniently positioned between The City and Canary Wharf. The neighbourhood provides a range of friendly independent shops, restaurants, sports facilities, and historic riverside inns, whilst the parks, canals, and beaches (yes beaches) along the banks of the Thames offer additional outdoor leisure space. There is also a regular Saturday food market with lots of yummy treats, refreshments, and entertainment. The area has excellent transport links, with Wapping Overground, Shadwell Overground /DLR, and Tower Hill Underground all just a short distance away. Local bus services (D3 and 100) and lots of tfl bike stations make traveling in and around the area super easy.<br><br>Did You Know? Wapping is situated between the north bank of the River Thames and the ancient thoroughfare simply called The Highway. Wapping's proximity to the river has given it a strong maritime character, which it retains through its riverside public houses and steps, such as the Prospect of Whitby and Wapping Stairs. It also has a Royal Navy shore establishment base on the riverfront called hms President and is home to Tobacco Dock and King Edward Memorial Park. Many of the original buildings were demolished during the construction of the London Docks and Wapping was further seriously damaged during the Blitz. As the London Docklands declined after the Second World War, the area became run-down, with the great warehouses left empty. The area's fortunes were transformed during the 1980s by the London Docklands Development Corporation when the warehouses started to be converted into luxury flats.<br><br>Properties such as this rarely become available and therefore early viewing is highly recommended.
